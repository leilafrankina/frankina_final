			<h2> How Restaurant Inspections Keep Us Healthy </h2>

			<h3>Why do restaurants need inspections?</h3>
			<img src="cooking.png" alt="Photo of cooking in a kitchen">
			<p>When eating out at a restaurant or any other facility with food service, you would want to know if the food you are eating is safe or not. Even though restaurants do not want to serve unsafe food to customers, proper protocols and policies are often disregarded or forgotten, which can affect the health of restaurant staff and customers or even the overall business of the restaurant. This is why restaurant inspections carried out by state officials are necessary.</p>
			
			<p>In Onondaga County, restaurant inspections are unannounced and done randomly. With over 1900 food service facilities to inspect, it can be difficult to constantly keep tabs on every single facility. The Onondaga County Health Department categorizes the facilities by risk level to determine how often they need to visit each of these places.</p>

			<p>Depending on how many violations a restaurant receives and how critical they are, food inspectors have the power to close it down. New York City Restaurant Inspector <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/dining/restaurant-health-inspector.html" target="_blank">Fayick Suleman</a> goes into his thought process during this type of situation.</p>

			<p>“I don’t think there is any inspector who takes pride in closing down a restaurant,” Suleman said. “But imagine food not being cooked to the right temperature, and someone getting very sick. That would make me feel even more guilty.”</p>

In the year 2022, the month of February had the highest number of inspections take place with a total of 2,748 inspections.

			<h3>What happens during restaurant inspections?</h3>
			<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ongov.net/health/" target="_blank">Onondaga County Health Department</a>, low risk facilities are places where not many problems could arise in relation to food safety violations. Examples of low-risk places would be ice cream stands or bars where they don't serve any food. Medium risk facilities are generally places that cook and serve, but they are not doing any hot holding, cold holding, or cooling of food. They also do not really have a lot of raw food that would have to be stored or cooked at a certain temperature. High risk facilities are the typical full service, sit down restaurants. They have to do very complex preparation on a daily basis such as cooking, cooling, and reheating raw foods. There is a lot of room for error in high-risk restaurants. High risk places are inspected twice a year, medium risk once a year and low risk can be done every other year.</p>

			<p>Gretchen Pierson, a supervisor in food protection, has been overseeing restaurant inspections in Onondaga County for years now. She says that the most common critical violations she comes across are potentials for cross contamination.</p> 

			<p>"For example, when we walk into a walk-in cooler, we might find a container of raw chicken stored on a shelf above a vegetable. That is considered a critical violation because we don't want the raw chicken to drip on the vegetable, that would be cross contamination and could lead to someone getting sick.”</p>

			<iframe title="The number of Item 15A- Violations found during food inspections has increased each year since 2010 " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3Xdx7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3Xdx7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
		
			<p>The most common violation amongst food service facilities in Onondaga County is Item 15A-   Floors, walls, ceilings, not smooth, properly constructed, in disrepair, dirty surfaces. It appeared a total of 417 times within the dataset.</p>

			<p>Restaurant inspections do not take very long if there are no violations found and the inspector can be gone within the hour. When the inspector starts to find more critical violations, the inspection could last a few hours or more. In Onondaga County, restaurant inspectors are required to stay at a restaurant if they find any critical violations until they are fixed. Mr. Suleman usually does 3-4 inspections a day depending on how each inspection goes, but it can be unpredictable sometimes. He explains how he does not have much power over what time he shows up at each restaurant.</p>

			<p>“Once we walk in, we can’t just say, ‘No, you are busy, let’s call it a day,’” Suleman said. “No matter the length of the line or how busy a restaurant is, I have to find a way to get the inspection done. It’s unavoidable.”</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Trying new foods at restaurants and eating out can be great, but you want to feel good and safe about the food you are eating. Getting sick from food is not a fun experience and restaurants can potentially be sued if something like that occurs. Pierson explains just how important restaurant inspections are for everyone.</p>

			<p>“Coming from a restaurant standpoint, having a lot of violations is not good for their business. It's their livelihood. If they have a big food, food and food illness outbreak, that's really going to hurt their business. From a public health standpoint, restaurant inspections are important because we want to keep people safe. Foodborne diseases cause 76 million illnesses in the U.S. each year, and almost half of all money spent on food is spent in restaurants. If we can help prevent that number from going up, we are going to do all that we can.”</p>
